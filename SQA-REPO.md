# SQA Report

Report your activities and lessons learned.

## Activities

1. We began by looking at all the Python files in the MLForensics.zip folder and decided to chose the `mining.py` file to fuzz and log since it had 5 self-contained methods with clear inputs and outputs which makes fuzzing a lot easier.

## Lessons Learned

1. Fuzz Testing: Learned automated input generation for edge cases.
2. Error Logging: Implemented comprehensive error handling and tracebacks.
3. CI/CD: Automated regression testing with GitHub Actions.
4. Python Exception Handling: Logged multiple types of runtime errors (IndexError, ValueError, OSError, etc.).
5. SQA Best Practices: Demonstrated reproducibility, traceability, and code robustness.
